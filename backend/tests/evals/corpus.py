"""Graded adversarial eval corpus for the AI advisor's deterministic safety stack.

Each entry is a (input/output, expected outcome) pair across the categories that
matter for a finance AI: prompt-injection recall, benign false-positive rate,
crisis detection, output grounding, compliance framing, and secret/SQL leakage.

This is deliberately model-free: it exercises `sanitize_input`, `detect_crisis`
and `validate_output` so it runs in milliseconds, costs nothing, and is fully
deterministic — i.e. safe to gate CI on. Live-model eval (groundedness scoring
of real completions) is a separate, sampled offline job; this is the regression
floor that must never drop.
